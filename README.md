# Bilda2 - A 2D Game Engine in Go using Raylib
An attempt at making a simple 2D game engine using Go and Raylib. NOTE THIS IS UNFINISHED - Will only currently run on 1920 X 1080 and if it doesn't work I am sorry.

The idea is to eventually one day when I have more time put the ideas into something a bit more polished that allows anyone, even with zero coding knowledge, to create 2D games without having to learn any overly complex new skills.

INSTRUCTIONS
Mouse input - navigate the left menu - add an object (OBJ+ Button). Everything is an object, you can then assign images to these objects, given them movements, colors etc.

Very unfinished though hopefully will be completed sometime in the next decade.
